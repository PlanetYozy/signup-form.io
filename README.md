I was having some trouble with the warnings that the user is supposed to get when they leave the box empty in React so i created the project again with JS but still ran into the same issues. I remedied this failure by adding a required keyword in my HTML file so that the user will still receive a warning if any box is left blank.

I also could not push my project from VSCODE to github like i usually do so I copied and pasted all my files into this repo and created a server with github pages so the full project can still be interacted with.

 This is the link to the project https://planetyozy.github.io/signup-form.io/ 
 
 Thank you for interview opportuniy and Merry Christmas
